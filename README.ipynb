    "I wrote this program totally inspired on Baptista's article \"Cryptography with Chaos\", in which the author suggests a cryptographic method using the logistic equation. It is very interesting, since it takes full advantage of this equation's chaotic behavior (sensitivity on initial conditions) for security implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it isn't a completely independent cryptographic method, as it relies on sending, alongside the encrypted message, the initial conditions (keys) used for the encryption, which would require some other (independent) form of cryptography. Still, an interesting read, and proposal, regardless.\n"

    "Blue dots represent fixed points of the equation, which appear after many consecutive iterations of _F_ applied on some initial condition _Xo_. When we have a finite number _N_ of points vertically above some _x_-axis value, we say we have a stable periodic orbit (of period _N_). Between 1 and 3, we have period 1; between 3 and 3.5, we have period 2, then period 4, etc, until chaos ensues at around 3.6 (we call it a period-doubling cascade/bifurcation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will take some specific values of _b_ (_x_-axis) such that we have a continuous vertical line; that is to say, it corresponds to _b_'s chaotic attractor. I assume it's preferable to use values greater than ~3.7 (and less than 4), since its chaotic attractor won't be disconnected, but maybe it doesn't really make a difference; it just needs to be a chaotic attractor.
